# Creating a Minimum Viable Product
If you have never read about the Abilene Paradox,go read about it. Bringing this to you...quote on quote...in this paradox
people don`t speak out what they need or declare rather the outcome is a result of flaws and misconceptions.What does this steach us? Expression as a person
and idealy as a human being is quite important. Again find out more....

### What is the big goal?
The big goal is to build great products and services. When you have the right tools and process with a driven mindset plus a great support team, there is 
nothing you can`t achieve.
### Having a Minimu Viable Specification
This means you need to have a clear path to what you need to do to get done including ways to solve errors,the name of the idea,a description of the problem statement and a statement of the output we expect from this specification.

### JUST BUILD AND FIGURE IT OUT LATER
This is a viable technique used to administer good workflow meaning , you create what yiu are thinking about then later finding out its purpose. On the contrary, waiting and strategising is important but could bring unforseen events such as delivering a project late or even playing what they call a "Whack-a-Mole".
